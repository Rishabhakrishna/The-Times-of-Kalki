The civility of debate before the turn of the millennium will be only mentioned in study sooner or later (not literally, but you get the point). Just thinking of those times when debate, whether official or simply recreational, was not a time to insult the person against you is saddening. And it is not just a lack of decorum observed â€” the inability to consider the validity of opposing views is decreasing in rarity by the day.
